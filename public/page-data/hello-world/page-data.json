We want to develop environments that foster mutual benefit, enable collective group action, and invite active participation in decentralized governance labs - shifting from the current web2 to a new web3 paradigm.

Our mission is to create solutions that facilitate synergies between social and technological communities. To achieve this, we are building a platform that envisions open decentralised networks as the future of human interaction. We want to encourage the community\\u2019s members to run controlled experiments with our new state-of-the-art technologies, such as curation markets for information rankings or non-transferable non-fungible tokens.

With growing concern over data safety and with new malicious exploits and hacks appearing every day, users have the right to engage in activities without the need for constant vigilance.

Some blockchains will focus on specific utilities, allowing for a variety of different collective actions.

There will come a point in time when sovereign networks comprising profoundly aligned online communities will arise. Invisible Hand Lab takes pride in being an integral component of this emergent movement, harnessing the potential of blockchain technology to forge novel social structures and institutions that nurture practical alternatives for a common future.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"At  Invisible Hand Lab  our vision entails harnessing novel technologies to elevate the manner in which individuals connect and engage withâ€¦"},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"blogTitle":"Invisible Hand Lab: Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency","date_published":"February 08, 2023","image":"/images/hand-blog-ne.jpeg","slug":"hello-world"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"hello-world","locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/hello-world","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","1247656359","3280999885","3280999885","4185913137","607815487","607815487"]}
