The MediLedger Network was developed by Chronicled to meet a key milestone of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), an FDA regulation which becomes active in November 2019.

Based on commitments to date, the MediLedger Network will process more than 80% of the saleable returns verifications by year end, with many different members of the pharma industry, including manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and software services providers, each running the decentralized software and connecting to the network through a common protocol.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The MediLedger Network brings together Fortune 500 companies and software service providers.
