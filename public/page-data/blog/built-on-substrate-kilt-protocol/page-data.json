These centralized data silos become honey pots for hackers, leaving our information vulnerable to theft and misuse.

Every time we want to access a service, some source of authority needs to verify the information we provide. Facebook and Google can provide that service today, saving us the trouble of having to log into every website with separate credentials. But if we can't trust companies like these with our data, there's currently no good solution.

KILT reduces or eliminates the need to blindly trust centralized services by providing a new way to manage credentials, giving users control over their own data, a key attribute of web 3.0.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"KILT Protocol is a permissionless common standard for managing credentials in a decentralized way. The system consists of three primary roles: Claimers, Attesters, and Verifiers. In this system, Claimers are the individual end users (or even objects/items\\u2014we'll get into this later) who want to present verifiable information about themselves to a third party or log into a particular service. Attesters are the sources of authority that confirm the truth of the claims being presented by the Claimers. Lastly, Verifiers are the third parties who want to verify that the claim is indeed true. Together, these roles create a comprehensive credentialing system that facilitates data accuracy without the singular point of failure of traditional web 2.0 systems.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"An example: residency verification\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Imagine you\\u2019re signing up for an app that needs to verify your local jurisdiction. Under the current regime, you'd need to prove your residency by handing over your passport or other official documents. This would give the service provider access not only to your place of residence, but to any other information contained in those documents, like your address or date of birth. Depending on the data privacy laws in your country, they may then be able to store that information indefinitely on their own vulnerable servers, multiplying the risk of a data breach.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"With a system built on KILT Protocol, by contrast, users would be able to prove their place of residence without offering any additional information about themselves. Instead of sharing an entire passport, Claimers would just share what's called a credential, which could represent any verifiable information or attribute about the claimer. In this case, the credential certifying the Claimer's place of residence would be provided directly to the Claimer by the Attester (i.e. the relevant agency). The credential then lives on the Claimer's device, who can then share it at will with the verifying app, providing only the necessary information (such as place of residence but not address).\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"KILT's value proposition\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In this system, users maintain full control over their data.

In the market of trust, only the most trusted Attesters will rise to the top, and Claimers can choose who they interact with.

Claims and attestations built into the protocol level can also be used for services like provenance and certification, or any use case where specific attributes need to be verified. Indeed, as mentioned above, Claimers in this system don't even necessarily have to be people. They can be organizations or even objects.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A good example of this would be a fair trade certification, where the Claimer could be a business wishing to prove their fair trade practices, or even an object. A bar of chocolate, for example, could be packaged with a credential that users can then verify with an app that confirms the credential on the blockchain. Under this scenario, the Attester would be a trusted authority in the sector like Fairtrade International.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Ultimately the number of use cases is as varied as the decentralized applications that will make use of KILT protocol in their services.
