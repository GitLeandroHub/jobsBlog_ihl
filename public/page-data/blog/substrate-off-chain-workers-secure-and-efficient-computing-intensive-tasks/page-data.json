Off-chain logic is therefore not only suited, but rather needed, whenever the computation is significant (like sophisticated democratic mechanisms such as delegated voting), the storage footprint is large (such as archiving staking information which may be required at a later time), where time is of the essence, where elements of the computation must remain private (such as nodes being able to manage their own secrets for eventual identification) or where the operations to be done are necessarily non-deterministic or otherwise localized (such as passing in random numbers, fetching data from a website or calling an external RPC).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"All of these examples and more would enrich many blockchains and decentralized networks and make them more useful to a myriad of new markets and participants, but there have been problems in establishing these services, even off-chain.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In traditional off-chain environments, there are a couple major pain points for secure off-chain computation:\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Off-chain mechanisms are an independent process, and as such they require their own maintenance that needs to be coordinated separately from the blockchain itself.
