Not only is this yet another clear example of why centralized platforms are bound for corruption, it is also a kick in the stomach to those who've championed their platform and arguably made it become the market leader that it is today. As to be expected, the response from the community has been frank and harsh. Many are calling for a revolt, building alternative systems and taking back control.

Without many built-in incentives or ways to make money for validators, there is also only one key reason you'd join this network: because you are using it yourself.
