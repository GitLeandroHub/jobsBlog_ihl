It saw thousands of Ether sent to address 0x0, as any transaction with an ill-formed \\u201Cto\\u201D address was interpreted by the client as a send to 0x0.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then a few months later a bug was discovered in a library of Javascript utilities written by the Foundation and used by many companies and individuals to generate wallets. It resulted in approximately 1 in 128 accounts, that were produced by some teams, being rendered useless. Thousands more Ether became stuck.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"While the hack on the DAO and the fork that followed are well known; The problems post-fork with transactions replaying across the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic network are not recognized as widely - a failure to anticipate that Ethereum Classic would not only survive but thrive post-fork led to a large number of issues. These included deposits of Ether to contracts that were never deployed on the Ethereum network in the first place.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Most recently, the incident with the Parity multi-signature wallet, where the contract which held the code governing the behaviour of the wallets, was deleted. This left anyone with Ether or tokens in Parity multi-sig wallets unable to withdraw them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"All of these funds are provably non-recoverable without a change in the blockchain\\u2019s state, opcode upgrades or consensus rules modification. It can be reasonably assumed that this was never thought to be the intention of the users or developers that sent the transactions or deployed contracts.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There have been other losses - it has proven all too easy to include a typo in an address and send your Ether to the incorrect address. These types of errors can unfortunately never be confirmed to be provably non-recoverable as the addresses where the Ether sit are valid and usable.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Similarly, while the transactions sent to 0x0 in the first weeks of Ethereum going live can be inferred to be a user error when writing transactions - since that period this address has been used as a \\u2018burn address\\u2019 to destroy both Ether and ERC 20 tokens. This muddies the water considerably in determining a \\u2018lack of intent to burn\\u2019 on transactions sent to this address.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"There Is a Solution\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No one should be under any illusion that unlocking these stuck funds would be anything other than a rescue operation - and would only be possible with a hard fork. In none of these cases was the protocol specifically at fault. Issues with client usability, problems with codebase maintained by both private entities and the Foundation code, the unexpected emergence of a competitor network, and plain user error have contributed to where we are today. \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethereum, as it is today, remains solid and continues to evolve.\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As it stands, many millions of dollars have been lost to many different groups of people due to these issues and others.

The discussion right now is whether these specific changes to the expected behavior of the network could have negative repercussions when some users have based their on-chain and off-chain behavior on the assumption that behavior would never change.

It allows private key holders affected by certain issues to withdraw their Ether.

Therefore, this generalized proposal provides no explicit favor to any single account, user, or application. This approach does not cover the funds locked in the Parity multi-signature wallets because the contract itself still contains code, and it would not allow the recovery of tokens other than Ether.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A second solution would be an \\u201Caddress specific\\u201D Ether and Tokens recovery. This is a solution that focuses on capturing as many edge cases as possible but one that is not tightly defined. It would require those that \\u2018hold the pen\\u2019 to define its scope. It is, however, the most straightforward solution and would not change the semantic behavior of the EVM but could still solve all of the cases previously raised. We understand the debate that may ensue from such a strategy.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A third solution, which was suggested by Parity, is a change to the Protocol which would allow the revival of suicided contracts and fine-grained deployment of contracts for all users going forward. It would restore the Parity multi-sig and other issues where contract addresses hold funds but have not had code deployed to them. It would also safeguard future incidents of a similar nature.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is another partial coverage with a \\u201Cstrict rules approach\\u201D, though it represents enough of a change in behavior of the EVM that it could be considered a functional enhancement to the platform as it no longer makes transaction ordering the determining factor in a contracts address. We prefer this solution as it adds functionality for users though the details are currently being debated. It currently has four different designs under review.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Next Steps\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Achieving good governance around hard forks and protocol upgrades on Ethereum has been an ongoing project. It has had its successes and failures with limited experiments with democracy, plutocracy, and technocracy. Good consensus has been achieved on technical enhancements while significant non-enhancement hard forks have been both failures (the Ethereum Classic split) and successes (the mining reward reduction) of consensus. This next discussion will be an important test of how contention can be turned into consensus.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Parity\\u2019s stance is this: It is our hope that the community would get behind a rescue of these funds to help all the users that we can.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Thanks for your time.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Your friends at InvisibleHandLab\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://gist.github.com/5chdn/a9bb8617cc8523a030126a3d1c60baf3\"\n  }, \"Appendix: Contract revival EIP specification drafts\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","timeToRead":4,"excerpt":"A Brief History Since Ethereum went live two and a half years ago, users and developers have often struggled with the usability and building…"},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"blogTitle":"We just released ink! 4.0!","date_published":"February 08, 2023","image":"/images/qsdh5p9.jpeg","slug":"we-just-released-ink-4-0"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"blogTitle":"Parity Leadership Update","date_published":"October 21, 2022","image":"/images/blog-post.png","slug":"blog/parity-leadership-update/"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"blogTitle":"Transitioning Parity Ethereum to OpenEthereum DAO","date_published":"December 16, 2019","image":"/images/parity-ethereum-openethereum.jpeg","slug":"blog/parity-ethereum-openethereum-dao/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blog/on-classes-of-stuck-ether-and-potential-solutions/","locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/blog/on-classes-of-stuck-ether-and-potential-solutions/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","1247656359","3280999885","3280999885","4123762078","4185913137","607815487","607815487"]}
