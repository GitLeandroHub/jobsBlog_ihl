The first is the pronounced speed with which Parity processes the first 100k blocks in the chain, clocking up > 1000 blocks/second for most of the time during that period. Notably, these were the blocks while the thawing was going on, was a gas limit (and thus transaction volume) substantially below today's 3M - many of these contain no transactions in them at all.

While the difference is liable to be somewhat overplayed since the values of transaction throughput for Parity are generally higher (and so we'd expect accordingly higher volatility over that value), it's nonetheless there. This is suggestive of bottlenecks outside of the paths strictly required for transaction processing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, Parity (and less noticeably, Geth) takes a big hit between block 690k and 850k before rising in transaction-processing speed on its way to 950k and beyond. Given block processing speed stayed more or less constant around that period, we might expect that the complexity or other nature of the transactions actually changed at that time. My guess is that it marked the start of a service on the mainnet that made substantial use of the EVM, thereby causing a substantial drop in transaction throughput.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's about all I can say from these graphs.
