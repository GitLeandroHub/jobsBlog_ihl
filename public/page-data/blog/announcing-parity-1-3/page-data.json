It has been a busy time for us (and the community as a whole!) with various events happening and vying for our time. Aside from ad-hoc protocol alterations, we've been working hard on a number of features and the 1.3 \\\"Acuity\\\" release includes some of the first tasters of these, not to mention some of the incremental improvements and fixes some of which have already been released in the (now stable!) 1.2 series.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We have been sharpening our focus on \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"optimisation\"), \". The core is now by far the fastest it has ever been: on my laptop, I can process the first 200,000 blocks of the Frontier chain (in the so-called \\\"clients' drag race\\\") in 94 seconds. Various parts of the client have been painstakingly profiled and optimised to make this happen; internal caching, database schemas, SHA3 batching and parallelisation, VM gas accounting and data compression all contribute to this score. There are still avenues we will be exploring to give even greater gains though and I hope to be able to report back a further reduced time in another couple of months :-)\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Aside from optimisations, we've also been looking at our \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"disk footprint\"), \".

Using our state snapshots, a heavily compressed \\\"just-what-you-need\\\" chain archive, you can have a fully synchronised chain from scratch in as little as 1 minute. Basically, we took all the important stuff in the database, used specially optimised compression and zipped it up into single archive file. By downloading this file (which stands at around 140MB), you can \\\"unzip\\\" it through Parity's special secure restore feature and have a working client in a jiffy.
