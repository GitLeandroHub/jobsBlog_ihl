At [Invisible Hand Lab](https://invisiblehandlab.org/) our vision entails harnessing novel technologies to elevate the manner in which individuals connect and engage with one another. We want to develop environments that foster mutual benefit, enable collective group action, and invite active participation in decentralized governance labs - shifting from the current web2 to a new web3 paradigm. These new interactions open up possibilities for different business logic and alternative ways of generating income, all while fostering an internal and stable economy based on cryptocurrency.

Decentralisation lies at the heart of our philosophy. Our mission is to create solutions that facilitate synergies between social and technological communities. To achieve this, we are building a platform that envisions open decentralised networks as the future of human interaction. We want to encourage the community’s members to run controlled experiments with our new state-of-the-art technologies, such as curation markets for information rankings or non-transferable non-fungible tokens. Fairness and balance are some of our driving principles, which are woven into the network’s design.

Privacy is also a priority for us. With growing concern over data safety and with new malicious exploits and hacks appearing every day, users have the right to engage in activities without the need for constant vigilance. We need technology that gives users complete control over their identity and personal information. As such, our team is dedicated to promoting permissionless decentralized systems where people or entities are not ranked on relative status or authority.

We foresee a future where blockchains are more diverse and integrated with each other, allowing for seamless interoperability. Some blockchains will focus on specific utilities, allowing for a variety of different collective actions. Digital and real-life assets will be easily accessible to everyone who adheres to these protocols. There will come a point in time when sovereign networks comprising profoundly aligned online communities will arise. Invisible Hand Lab takes pride in being an integral component of this emergent movement, harnessing the potential of blockchain technology to forge novel social structures and institutions that nurture practical alternatives for a common future.
